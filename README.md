**Synopsis**

This project creates plots with data obtained from the Sense HAT.

Although code is ready for the Sense HAT, it can be used for any sensors just changing a few lines.

Both csv files where data is saved and the generated plot are saved into the folder of an Apache2 Virtual Host, so data can be tracked just with a network connection. However, these files can be saved in any other folder if wanted.

Matplotlib is used to generate the plot so it must be installed: http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

John D. Hunter was the creator of the amazing Matplotlib, so this project is in memory of him.

DashboardPi has been created by Iker Garc√≠a.

**Motivation**

I have an account at Initial State, which is really amazing as a dashboard (of course much better than this approach). Even if the free account was enough for me a few months ago, now I need to store my data for more than 24 hours. There are some paid plans but, being this an amateur use, they are not worth for me. For a more heavy use it is a well paid service!

**Contributors**

Everyone can contribute to this project, improving the code or adding functions. I will add, in the future, code for different plots and more examples.
